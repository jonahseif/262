I am at the Bren School as I transition out of a career in athletics to a career in the environmental field. With no former professional experience in this setting, I am focused on acquiring hard skills to put on my resume to accompany my former experience. My goal is to work in corporate sustainability and based on my conversations with those in that sector, data plays a huge role. I am eager to learn more about computing for environmental science and also to take modeling next quarter.

My data science background is next to none. Before the Bren School, I had zero experience or knowledge with coding or data science. I took Allison's 206 course last year, but have not taken any other data science courses or done any work with it since then.
