## Contract
##### Inputs:
Flow area (m2), Wet perimeter (m), Channel slope (m/m)

##### Output:
Flow Rate (m3/s)

##### Parameters:
Manning's coefficient (unitless), Constant k (m^(1/3) / m^(1/3)), Hydraulic radius (m)

##### Modules:
- Calculate flow area from a given length and width (flow_area)
- Utilize gradient measurements to calculate channel slope (channel_slope)
- Find hydraulic radius given area and wet perimeter (hydraulic_radius)
- Calculate flow rate using inputs and parameters (flow_rate)
